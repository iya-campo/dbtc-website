				<p id="left">This is Don Bosco Technical College in Mandaluyong.
				<br>
				<br>
				It was established only in 1953.
				<br>
				<br>
				Prior to this, a Spanish Augustinian Convent once stood here built in 1716 when Mandaluyong was still a Barrio of Sta Ana,an indenpendent town then from Manila. In 1883,the Philippine Augustinian Province requested the Spanish beatas of Barcelona to take charge of the newly established Casa Asilo de Nuestra Señora de la Consolación de Mandaloya.
				<br>
				<br>
				In short, Asilo De Mandaluyong. 6 beatas, including the blood sisters Rita and Consuelo Barceló accepted the invitation and set up a new beaterio with orphanage in the former Casa Hacienda of the Augustinians. This was the nucleus of the present Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation (ASOLC). Mother Consuelo Barcelo y Pages stayed here for 16 years (1883–1899). She co-founded the Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation along with her sister, the Spanish nun Servant of God Madre Rita Barcelo y Pages.
				<br>
				<br>
				It opened on December 26, 1884 and the sponsor was Doña Maria del Carmen Ayala de Roxas,wife of Don Pedro Roxas and great grandmother of cousins Don Enrique and Don Jaime Zobel De Ayala.
				<br>
				<br>
				At the Asilo, she provided the children with food, shelter, clothing, education they needed. She also spent a great deal of time giving music lessons. Early in the 20th century, the building became the San Carlos Seminary, home for the formation of the local clergy. One of them was Rufino Cardinal Santos, the first Filipino cardinal of the Church. Dn Bosco Mandaluyong opened as a school aptly named "Don Bosco Technical Institute–Mandaluyong on June 3,1953 with 47 first-year high school students. But on August 19, 1896, The Katipunan was discovered here. Teodoro Patiño ,a printing press worker for the Diario De Manila from Tondo had a misunderstanding with a fellow Katipunero. He went to the Asilo to tell his sister Honoria Patiño who was living with the nuns about the existence of the KKK. Teodoro Patiño would like to bring her out and escape for he believe that the Katipuneros might attack the Asilo. It upset Honoria and told the orphanage’s Mother Superior, Sor Teresa de Jesus. Sor Teresa suggested they seek the advice of Father Mariano Gil, the parish priest of Tondo. After hearing Teodoro Patiño’s revelations, Father Mariano Gil accompanied by several Guardias Civiles immediately searched the premises of Diario de Manila and found evidence of the Katipunan’s existence. The Governor General was quickly informed. Fearing reprisals from the revolutionaries upon the discovery of the Katipunan in 1896, the Barcelo sisters and the Filipino beatas prayed ardently to their patroness, Our Lady of Consolation. No untoward incident occurred anywhere near the premises of the orphanage. In 1898 , Mother Consuelo was already the superior of the Colegio-Asilo while Mother Rita was the mistress of novices.
				<br>
				<br>
				During the Filipino-American war, Mother Consuelo and Mother Rita, the sisters and their almost 200 orphan-wards left the Asilo on June 11, 1898. They fled towards Manila. When the Americans came, the Augustinian provincial officially dissolved the sisters’ community, as well as their Colegio-Asilo De Mandaluyong. Mother Rita and Mother Consuelo, left the Philippines for Spain on March 13, 1899.
				<br>
				<br>
				So the Asilo became a Seminary in the early 1900s
				<br>
				<br>
				Then Don Bosco in 1953.
